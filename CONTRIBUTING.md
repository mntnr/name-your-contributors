## Commits

Please conform to the [Angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) when committing, and in your pull requests. We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to semantically understand what is happening in commits, to generate changelogs automatically, and to publish to npm.

You can also use [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to write valid commit messages either using `npm run commit` or `git cz` if you have globally installed `commitizen`.
